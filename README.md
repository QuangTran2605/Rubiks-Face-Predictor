# Rubik's Cube Last Face Predictor
We are interested in whether we can, given 5 faces of a Rubik's Cube, predict the last face's pattern, using a ML model.  

## Description
We'll start by feeding a set of images (2-5) to the model, which captures the patterns on 5 faces of the cube sitting on a table. Then the task is to figure out the exact pattern on the last face, which is hidden from view.
